This project is an "exclusive clubhouse" website that requires authentication in order to users to write and view authors of posts. It is built using Ruby on Rails.

The project demonstrates various concepts and functions related to authentication, sessions, and cookies, including getting/setting cookie and session variables, security (e.g., encryption and signing), controller filters, and usage of the Devise gem.

This project is currently in progress.
